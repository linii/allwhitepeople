This version removes characteristics that aren't considered 'default' (i.e. being white, straight, male) so that being white/straight/male is emphasized as abnormal and made more alien rather than appearing as the default.

This can be switched back to the normal swapping version by editing the dictionaries in script.js so that words switch meaning instead of being replaced by empty strings.
